# Turbine-downtime-chatbot

The "Turbine Downtime Chatbot" project leverages Google DialogFlow and custom
webhooks to create an intelligent virtual assistant tailored for addressing downtime
incidents in turbine systems. This innovative solution aims to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of managing turbine downtimes, resulting in improved operational
performance and reduced unplanned outages.

The chatbot facilitates natural language interaction, allowing operators and maintenance
personnel to swiftly report and diagnose downtime incidents. If it gets real-time access
to turbine data and historical insights, it assists in identifying downtime causes and
predicting potential issues, enabling proactive maintenance. Customization options
make the chatbot adaptable to various turbine systems and maintenance protocols.

Currently the chatbot can be used to know the reason of turbine failure and the suitable 
action to resolve the failure.
